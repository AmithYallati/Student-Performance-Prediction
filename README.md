# Student Performance Prediction ðŸŽ“

This project aims to predict students' academic performance based on various factors like attendance, study habits, and socio-economic variables using a machine learning model.

## Project Structure
- `model.py`: The main script for building and training the model.
- `requirements.txt`: A file specifying the necessary dependencies.
- `data/xAPI-Edu-Data.csv`: The dataset used in this project.

## Dataset
We used the `xAPI-Edu-Data.csv` dataset, which includes features like gender, nationality, attendance, parental engagement, and student interaction metrics, with the target being student performance classified as Low, Medium, or High.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running:
3. Run the `model.py` script:

## Model Performance
The RandomForestClassifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 84%.
